//primitive data types in javaScript

let x =161616; //numbers
x= "hghjgjhdgfjhdg"; //string
x= true; //boolean
x =null; // null 
x = undefined;

// x= Symbol();
//The JavaScript ES6 introduced a new primitive data type called Symbol. 
//Symbols are immutable (cannot be changed) and are unique.


//typeof is function which shows the datatypes of variables
// console.log((typeof x)+":"+x)

// Null in JavaScript means an empty value and is also a primitive type in JavaScript. 
// The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value.
// Undefined, on the other hand, means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned.
